## nro-ovl-asset-editor
This project is a fork of [nro-asset-editor](https://github.com/vgmoose/nro-asset-editor/), all credit goes toward them.
I needed a way to edit assets inside of .ovl files aswell as .nro files, because sometimes I get annoyed with the strange versioning some homebrew or sysmodules have, and the way they are visualised in for e.g. Tesla Overlay.

I decided to move from tkinter, because I could. In any case, like I stated. Any and all credit goes towards the dev of the original tool.

## nro-asset-editor
Edit asset data in Switch homebrew .nro files according to the Assets layout described on [switchbrew](http://switchbrew.org/index.php?title=NRO#Assets).

Using this program it should be possible to add/change icons and metadata for any hbmenu homebrew apps. It can be downloaded from the [release page](https://github.com/vgmoose/nro-asset-editor/releases).

### GUI
To run the GUI, either run the precompiled binary from the release page, or run `maker.py` without any additional arguments.

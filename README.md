## nro-ovl-asset-editor
This project is a fork of [nro-asset-editor](https://github.com/vgmoose/nro-asset-editor/), all credit goes toward them.
I needed a way to edit assets inside of .ovl files aswell as .nro files, because sometimes I get annoyed with the strange versioning some homebrew or sysmodules have, and the way they are then visualised in for e.g. Tesla Overlay. My brain likes conformity.

I decided to move from tkinter, because I could. In any case, like I stated. Any and all credit goes towards the dev of the original tool. I don't know what's customary when it comes to stuff like this, original LICENSE is provided.

### GUI
To run the GUI, either run the precompiled binary from the release page, or run `maker.py` without any additional arguments.
